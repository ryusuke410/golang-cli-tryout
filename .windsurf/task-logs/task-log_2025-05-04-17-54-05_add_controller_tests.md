# Task Log: Add Controller Test Files

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-04
- **Time Started**: 17:45
- **Time Completed**: 17:54
- **Files Modified**: 
  - internal/controller/urfavecontroller/root_test.go
  - internal/controller/urfavecontroller/transform_test.go

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Create test files for root and transform commands following the pattern from math_test.go
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created root_test.go with test for root command
  - Created transform_test.go with tests for base64 and url-encode commands
  - Followed math_test.go pattern for:
    - Mock object creation
    - Mock expectations
    - Command creation
    - Context and argument setup
    - Command execution and result verification
  - Fixed imports to match math_test.go exactly
  - Used proper package references (urfavecontroller.NewRootCommand)
- **Challenges**: 
  - Initially missed some imports from math_test.go
  - Had to fix unused imports
  - Needed to update command creation to use full package path
- **Decisions**: 
  - Followed math_test.go pattern exactly for consistency
  - Used proper package references for command creation
  - Maintained same test structure and naming conventions

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Created comprehensive test coverage for root and transform commands
  - Followed existing test patterns exactly
  - Fixed all import issues
  - Maintained consistent test structure
- **Areas for Improvement**: None

## Next Steps
- Review test coverage
- Consider adding more test cases for edge scenarios
- Monitor test performance
